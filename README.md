- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  background-image: linear-gradient(hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1),hsla(241, 72%, 46%, 0));
}
I learned how to add a gradient to the background color.
.proud-of-this-css {
  @media screen and (max-width: 750px);
}
I learned how to change the design when the screen width is below a specific pixel value using media queries.
.proud-of-this-css {
  @font-face;
}
I learned how to apply a specific font.
```

### Continued development

I don't know how to place text in the center of a circle. I temporarily resolved the issue using line breaks, but I want to fix this problem with the correct method in the near future.

### Useful resources

- https://studiomeal.com/archives/533 - This is an amazing article which helped me understand CSS grid. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

## Acknowledgments

I recommend using CSS grid. It's helpful to address issues from larger to smaller, top to bottom. Creating a perfect result from the beginning is challenging. Start by building it, and as you make incremental adjustments, you'll soon get closer to your goal."
